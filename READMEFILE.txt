VERY IMPORTANT: SEED THE DATABASE WITH THE SEED METHODS FOR ONE HR AND ONE LOCATION FOR THIS WHOLE PROJECT
THROUGH POSTMAN

Deployment:
I wasnt able to do deployment with the way I did my routing and server since they are both in the same file


1. Open a terminal at /backend/main.js and node main.js to run the BACKEND
2. Open a terminal at app.js and npm start to run the FRONTEND

 NEW:
2.BACKEND listens on port localhost:5000
3.REACT(FRONTEND) listens on port localhost:3000


Notes:
I made a mistake in milestone 1 where I put the login under authentication/ This is fixed by just placing login over
app.use(authenticate)

I added Some routes for the frontEnd use only like get all Locations but this is mainly the same readme file as before
with some route urls changed to suit FrontEnd side 









First: 
SEED THE DATABASE WITH Functions 1 & 2 THROUGH POSTMAN and then Login in the front end through localhost:3000
with the newly formed HR Member 

ROUTES ARE IN THIS ORDER
1.HR
2.HOD
3.COURSE INSTRUCTOR
3.COURSE COORDINATOR
4.ACADEMIC MEMBER





ALL OF THE ROUTES UNDER TILL THE END ARE IN THE BACKEND
